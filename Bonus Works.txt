As for the extra credits,
I've included two functionalities.
First one is the reverse geocoding, allowing the user
to look up location with latitude and longitude,
not just the location name.
This could have been a real simple function, just
moving the map to the latitude and longitude the user specified.
However, my second function does not allow it to be that simple.
My second function was to display the flag of the country
the location is in. Because of this function, I had to use
Google Maps API for both location name and coordinates.
I got the JSON file from Google, then pulled out the country name.
Then the country name was sent to geotree API which sent back the
image file for me to display. For this, I had to set up the downloader
class for the app.

I think my functions got the first 5 bonus points covered, using the 
country name as that extra information. As for the second bonus,
reverse geocoding using Google Maps API/displaying flag by downloading image
probably doesn't deserve all 15 points- I'd think 7-8 points at best.
